## ‚ùì COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "How does consistency regularization work?"
**A:** "It enforces consistency between model predictions on different augmentations, improving generalization."

### Q: "Why these specific strategies?"
**A:** "They complement each other: consistency improves generalization, pseudo-labeling leverages unlabeled data, co-training provides ensemble benefits."

### Q: "What's the computational overhead?"
**A:** "While there is some overhead, the performance gains justify the cost. Our framework is optimized for efficiency."

### Q: "How do you handle noisy labels?"
**A:** "We implemented robust loss functions (GCE, SCE, Forward Correction) that handle noisy labels effectively."

## üñ•Ô∏è DEMO SCRIPT

### Setup (30 seconds):
"Let me demonstrate our framework in action. I'll train a model with 10% labeled data on CIFAR-10."

### Training (1 minute):
"Here you can see the training progress. Notice how the accuracy improves as the model learns from both labeled and unlabeled data."

### Results (30 seconds):
"This shows our performance comparison. The framework achieves high accuracy with minimal labeled data."
