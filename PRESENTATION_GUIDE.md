This approach enhances model performance and efficiency, showcasing the potential of combining multiple WSL strategies and deep learning for complex real-world problems."

### SLIDE 10.1: Algorithm Usage (2 minutes)
**What to say:**
"Let me explain the four key algorithms we implemented:

1. **Consistency Regularization**: This WSL technique enforces consistency between model predictions on different augmentations of the same input. It involves training the model to produce similar outputs for different views of the same data, improving generalization and robustness. The algorithm applies data augmentation techniques and penalizes inconsistent predictions, leading to better performance on unlabeled data.

2. **Pseudo-Labeling**: This WSL strategy uses model predictions as labels for unlabeled data. The algorithm selects high-confidence predictions from the model and treats them as ground truth labels for training. This approach leverages the abundance of unlabeled data to improve model performance iteratively. The technique involves confidence thresholding and iterative self-training.

3. **Co-Training**: This WSL approach trains multiple models on different views of the same data. The algorithm leverages the assumption that different views of data provide complementary information, improving overall model performance through ensemble predictions. This approach involves training separate models on different data representations or augmentations.

4. **Robust Loss Functions**: GCE, SCE, and Forward Correction are designed to handle noisy and inconsistent labels in WSL scenarios. GCE provides noise-robust training by down-weighting potentially noisy samples. SCE combines forward and backward loss terms for symmetric learning. Forward Correction applies label noise correction techniques."
