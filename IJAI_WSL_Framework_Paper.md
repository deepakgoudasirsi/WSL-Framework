## 1. INTRODUCTION (10 PT)

The modern computational environment has experienced an extraordinary surge in data creation, generating extensive and complex datasets where labeled information represents only a tiny portion. Traditional supervised learning approaches require substantial labeled datasets, which often prove economically unfeasible, time-consuming, or operationally impractical in real-world situations. This core challenge has spurred the development of weakly supervised learning (WSL) frameworks designed to efficiently utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to achieve outstanding model performance with minimal supervision requirements.

Weakly supervised learning tackles the fundamental challenge of building robust machine learning models when labeled data availability is severely limited. Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches that require extensive labeled datasets, WSL frameworks can achieve comparable performance using only 5-20% of labeled data by effectively leveraging the abundant unlabeled data available in most applications. This capability becomes particularly valuable in domains including computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, and autonomous systems where data annotation proves prohibitively expensive or time-consuming.

The primary challenge in WSL involves developing methodologies capable of effectively learning from limited labeled data while utilizing the vast quantities of unlabeled data to enhance model performance. Current approaches typically focus on individual strategies including consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, or co-training, but fail to leverage the synergistic benefits of integrating multiple strategies within a unified framework. Additionally, existing methodologies often face challenges with scalability, robustness to noise, and adaptability across diverse datasets and tasks.

This research introduces a unified WSL framework that addresses these limitations by integrating multiple WSL strategies with advanced deep learning techniques. The framework combines consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, and co-training approaches with sophisticated neural network architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ResNet18, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). The system also incorporates noise-resistant learning techniques such as Generalized Cross Entropy (GCE) and Symmetric Cross Entropy (SCE) to handle label noise and improve model robustness.

The primary contributions of this work include: (1) a unified framework that combines multiple WSL strategies for enhanced performance, (2) integration of noise-resistant learning techniques to handle label noise and improve model robustness, (3) comprehensive evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrating superior performance relative to individual strategies, (4) detailed analysis of the effectiveness of different WSL approaches and their practical applications, and (5) competitive performance achievement with computational efficiency considerations.

The framework undergoes evaluation on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with comprehensive performance analysis utilizing metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and robustness. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the unified approach substantially outperforms individual WSL strategies and attains performance comparable to fully supervised learning while utilizing only 10% labeled data.

## 2. METHOD (10 PT)

### 2.1 Framework Architecture

Our unified WSL framework consists of several interconnected components designed to work together effectively in achieving robust learning with limited labeled data. The architecture includes data preprocessing, strategy implementation, model training, and evaluation modules. The framework's design philosophy emphasizes modularity, scalability, and adaptability to diverse datasets and computational environments.

**Data Preprocessing Module**: The framework begins with comprehensive data preprocessing procedures including cleaning, normalization, and augmentation techniques. For image datasets, transformations including rotation, flipping, cropping, and brightness adjustment are implemented to enhance data diversity and strengthen model robustness. The data is subsequently systematically partitioned into labeled and unlabeled portions according to the specified ratio (typically 10% labeled, 90% unlabeled).

**Strategy Implementation Module**: The framework's core implements three fundamental WSL strategies:

1. **Consistency Regularization**: This methodology ensures that the model produces consistent predictions for identical inputs subjected to different perturbations or augmentations. The implementation employs a teacher-student architecture wherein the teacher model undergoes updates via exponential moving average of the student model parameters. The consistency loss is computed as the mean squared error between teacher and student predictions.

2. **Pseudo-Labeling**: This methodology creates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data based on model confidence levels. The strategy selects high-confidence predictions (typically exceeding 95% confidence threshold) and utilizes them as training targets for the unlabeled data. The pseudo-labels are generated using temperature scaling to improve calibration accuracy.

3. **Co-Training**: This methodology employs multiple models trained on distinct views of the data. Each model generates predictions on unlabeled data, and high-confidence predictions from one model are used to train the other models. This approach leverages the diversity of different model architectures to improve overall performance.

**Model Training Module**: The framework accommodates multiple deep learning architectures including CNNs, ResNet18, and MLPs. Each model undergoes training utilizing a combination of supervised loss on labeled data and unsupervised loss from the WSL strategies. The training process incorporates early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpointing to guarantee optimal performance. The training pipeline implements adaptive learning rate scheduling with cosine annealing and gradient clipping to prevent gradient explosion.

**Figure 1: Framework Architecture**
The figure illustrates the comprehensive system architecture of our proposed weakly supervised learning framework, showing the hierarchical flow from data input through preprocessing, strategy implementation, model training, and performance evaluation. The architecture integrates multiple WSL strategies (consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, and co-training) with diverse neural network architectures (CNN, ResNet18, MLP) to achieve robust learning with limited labeled data.

**Figure 2: Training Curves**
The figure shows accuracy vs epochs for different strategies (consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, co-training, and combined approach) on both CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.

The figure presents plots showing the robustness of different loss functions (GCE, SCE, standard cross-entropy) under various noise levels (0%, 10%, 20%). The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of noise-resistant learning techniques in maintaining performance under noisy conditions.

### 2.2 Noise-Resistant Learning Techniques

To address label noise and enhance model robustness, the framework integrates several sophisticated loss functions:

**Generalized Cross Entropy (GCE)**: This loss function is engineered to be robust against label noise by down-weighting potentially noisy samples. The GCE loss is calculated as:

L_{GCE} = (1 - p_i^q) / q	(1)

where p_i represents the predicted probability for the true class and q denotes a hyperparameter that governs the robustness level.

**Symmetric Cross Entropy (SCE)**: This loss function amalgamates standard cross-entropy with reverse cross-entropy to enhance robustness:

L_{SCE} = α ⋅ L_{CE} + β ⋅ L_{RCE}	(2)

where L_{CE} represents the standard cross-entropy loss, L_{RCE} denotes the reverse cross-entropy loss, and α, β represent weighting parameters.

### 2.3 Experimental Configuration

The experimental evaluation was performed on two benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Each dataset was systematically partitioned into labeled and unlabeled portions with ratios of 10% labeled data. The computational infrastructure comprised an Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 CPU, NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 32GB VRAM, 64GB DDR4 RAM, and 1TB NVMe SSD storage.

The training process employed the following hyperparameters: learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 128, maximum epochs of 100, weight decay of 1e-4, early stopping patience of 10, temperature of 0.5 for consistency regularization, confidence threshold of 0.95 for pseudo-labeling, and equal weighting (1.0) for consistency and pseudo-label losses.

### 2.4 Implementation Details

The framework was implemented using PyTorch 1.12.0 with CUDA 11.6 support. The CNN architecture consists of three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. The ResNet18 implementation follows the standard architecture with batch normalization and skip connections. The MLP architecture comprises three hidden layers with 512, 256, and 128 neurons respectively, using ReLU activation and dropout (0.3) for regularization.

Data augmentation techniques include random horizontal flipping (p=0.5), random rotation (±15 degrees), random brightness and contrast adjustment (±0.2), and random cropping with padding. The framework implements a custom data loader that handles both labeled and unlabeled data streams efficiently.

### 2.5 Framework Optimization Strategies

The framework incorporates several optimization strategies to enhance performance and efficiency:

**Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling**: The framework implements cosine annealing with warm restarts to optimize convergence. The learning rate follows the schedule:

η_t = η_min + ½(η_max - η_min)(1 + cos(π * T_cur / T_i)),

where T_cur is the current epoch and T_i is the restart interval.

**Gradient Clipping**: To prevent gradient explosion, the framework applies gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0. This ensures stable training across different model architectures and datasets.

**Dynamic Strategy Weighting**: The framework employs adaptive weighting of different WSL strategies based on their performance during training. The weights are updated every 10 epochs using exponential moving average:

α_k^(t) = β * α_k^(t-1) + (1-β) * (perf_k / Σ_j perf_j),

where β = 0.9.

### 2.6 Mathematical Formulations

The framework implements several mathematical formulations to ensure robust learning:

**Consistency Regularization Loss:**
L_consistency = E_{x∈D_u} [||f_θ(x) - f_θ'(x)||²]	(3)

where f_θ represents the student model and f_θ' represents the teacher model with parameters updated via exponential moving average.

**Pseudo-Labeling Loss:**
L_pseudo = E_{x∈D_u} [1(ŷ > τ) × CE(f_θ(x), ŷ)]	(4)

where ŷ represents the pseudo-label, τ is the confidence threshold (0.95), and CE is the cross-entropy loss.

**Co-Training Loss:**
L_co-training = E_{x∈D_u} [CE(f_θ₁(x), ŷ₂) + CE(f_θ₂(x), ŷ₁)]	(5)

where f_θ₁ and f_θ₂ represent two different models, and ŷ₁, ŷ₂ are their respective predictions.

**Combined Loss Function:**
L_total = α × L_supervised + β × L_consistency + γ × L_pseudo + δ × L_co-training	(6)

where α, β, γ, δ are adaptive weights that are updated during training based on strategy performance.
