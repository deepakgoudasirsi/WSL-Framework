## 10. ALGORITHM USAGE

### Slide 10.1: Algorithm Usage
1. Consistency Regularization :
Consistency regularization is a WSL technique that enforces consistency between model predictions on different augmentations of the same input. It involves training the model to produce similar outputs for different views of the same data, improving generalization and robustness. The algorithm applies data augmentation techniques and penalizes inconsistent predictions, leading to better performance on unlabeled data. Applications include image classification, text classification, and semi-supervised learning scenarios where labeled data is limited.

2. Pseudo-Labeling :
Pseudo-labeling is a WSL strategy that uses model predictions as labels for unlabeled data. The algorithm selects high-confidence predictions from the model and treats them as ground truth labels for training. This approach leverages the abundance of unlabeled data to improve model performance iteratively. The technique involves confidence thresholding and iterative self-training, making it effective for scenarios with limited labeled data. Applications include semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, and scenarios where manual labeling is expensive or time-consuming.

3. Co-Training :
Co-training is a WSL approach that trains multiple models on different views of the same data. The algorithm leverages the assumption that different views of data provide complementary information, improving overall model performance through ensemble predictions. This approach involves training separate models on different data representations or augmentations and combining their predictions. Applications include multi-view learning, ensemble methods, and scenarios where multiple data sources or representations are available.

4. Robust Loss Functions (GCE, SCE, Forward Correction) :
Robust loss functions are designed to handle noisy and inconsistent labels in WSL scenarios. Generalized Cross Entropy (GCE) provides noise-robust training by down-weighting potentially noisy samples. Symmetric Cross Entropy (SCE) combines forward and backward loss terms for symmetric learning. Forward Correction applies label noise correction techniques to improve model robustness. These algorithms are essential for real-world applications where data quality varies and label noise is common.
